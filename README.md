Exploding Bunnies project

Hey everybody,
So right now I have most of the ParkingSpot, Lot, Vehicle classes done. Most of
it should be commented but if you don't know what going on just ask. I tried
to stick to the class and state chars we had.
The biggest things to deal with now are going to be the GUI and the client 
server aspect. The GUI will be a good bit of work and I can try to handle the 
client/server.

We got this guys
